# Differential Computation in Python

This repository provides Python code for computing both ordinary and partial derivatives of mathematical functions. The code includes detailed step-by-step solutions and dynamic LaTeX rendering for clarity.

## Features

- **Ordinary Differentiation**: Computes the derivative of a function with respect to a single variable.
- **Partial Differentiation**: Computes the partial derivatives of a function with respect to multiple variables.
- **Detailed Solution**: Displays each step of the differentiation process using LaTeX for clear presentation.
- **Dynamic Output**: Generates LaTeX-formatted outputs to visualize the steps and results.

## Requirements

To run the provided code, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `sympy`: For symbolic mathematics and differentiation.
- `IPython`: For displaying LaTeX in Jupyter notebooks.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy ipython
```

## Usage
1. **Define the Function**: Input the mathematical function you want to differentiate.
2. **Specify Variables**: List the variables with respect to which you want to perform differentiation.
3. **Run the Code**: Execute the code to compute derivatives and view step-by-step solutions.
